# How to get started on this project

# Introduction #

super-go uses C++. Since the test environment is Windows, we will build it with Visual Studio.

We will use the POCO C++ library to do logging and threading.


# Details #

See http://blog.csdn.net/ishow99/archive/2009/12/02/4921739.aspx for how to use POCO in Visual Studio.

I'll put up a prebuilt version on svn, with visual studio 2010.
