\section{Pattern Matching}

This part integrates some of knowledge of human Go players into SuperGo. We have stored some existed patterns (or Joseki) in our SuperGo to make it ``think'' more like a human player. 

When several candidate moves have been generated by Monte-Carlo simulation, each move is then matched to see if it follows a Joseki stored in our pattern database. If a candidate move matches a Joseki quite perfectly, it is highly likely that this is a quite good move. Therefore, a candidate move that matches a Joseki is given higher score so that a move generator will have a higher possibility to choose it.

Compared with Monte-Carlo simulation, pattern matching is more rigid and yields high efficiency. Actually, using pattern matching techniques in Go game is similar to ``standing on the giants' shoulders''.

\subsection{Pattern Representation}

Most of the patterns we use in SuperGo only consider the local situations. Hence, we use a standard way to represent these patterns. We use two-dimensional char arrays to store local patterns. The examples are as follows:

\begin{verbatim}
                               ?.??           ??xx?
                               O*.O           O.xx?
                               .X..           .?X.O
                                              .O*..
                                              .....
                                              -----
\end{verbatim}

The different symbols stand for different meanings, and they are shown as follows. Such representations are easy for the human to read and comprehend.

\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{l|l}
\textbf{Symbols} & \textbf{Meanings} \\ \hline
$?$ & don't care \\
$.$ & empty \\
$X$ & your stone \\
$O$ & your opponent's stone \\
$x$ & your stone or empty \\
$o$ & your opponent's stone or empty \\
$*$ & your next recommended move \\
$-$ or $\mid$ & edges of board \\
$+$ & corner of board \\
\end{tabular}
\end{center}

\subsection{Matching and Scoring}

We have stored over $2000$ patterns in our pattern database. When doing matching, we have also taken into consideration rotations, reflections of patterns. Therefore, we have a combination of over $100000$ patterns in SuperGo.

Candidate moves that satisfy more patterns will receive a higher score, matching a corner pattern will earn a candidate move higher score, and matching a larger pattern (ie. $8 \times 8$ array) will be given higher ratings.
